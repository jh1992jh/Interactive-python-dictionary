Python command line program that returns definition/definitions for the words user inputs:

Example:
User inputs the word "rain", output will be "Precipitation in the form of liquid water drops with diameters greater than 0.5 millimetres. To fall from the clouds in drops of water"

User inputs a closely matching word "rain", The program asks:  Did you mean rain instead?
Press Y if yes or N if no? If N/n is chosen an error message is displayed, if Y/y is chosen the program outputs the definition/definitions for the word.

User inputs a invalid word that is not in the dictionary or doesn't closely match any words is the dictionary, output will be a error message.

The program is case insensitive e.g. user input RaiN matches with rain.
